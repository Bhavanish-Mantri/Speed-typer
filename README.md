# Speed Typer

Speed Typer is a browser-based typing game built using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The objective is to type randomly generated words as quickly and accurately as possible before the timer runs out.

This project emphasizes **UI stability**, **scalable design**, and **clean game-state management** without using frameworks or heavy external dependencies.
